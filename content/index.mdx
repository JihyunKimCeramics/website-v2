        This body of series was inspired by Jihyun's grandmother's ritual of
        placing a small ceramic jar filled with salt near the entrance of their
        South Korean home. This jar was believed to prevent negative energy and
        evil spirits from entering the household, and it is a widely held belief
        and superstition in South Korea.
