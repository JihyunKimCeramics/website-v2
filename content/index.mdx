        To celebrate the Lunar New Year, Jihyun and Woojin Joo has teamed up to
        create this limited edition sculpture combining both of their craft and
        unique style.


        ‘Blue Snake’ imagines the 2025 zodiac symbol snake as an enchanting
        presence, to bring the prosperity and longevity it symbolises to the
        home.


        The two makers are both based at Cockpit Studios, where they first met.
        Jihyun, through ceramics, and Woojin, through textiles, explore themes
        of mythology, folklore, and nature in their practice.

        Teoju is inspired by the Korean god Teojusin, traditionally represented
        as the god of land, who protects the earth where the home is located.
        Traditionally, by placing a big pot surrounded by straw with a
        cone-shaped lid in their yard, Korean ancestors wished for good luck and
        thanked Teojusin for blessing the land.


        In this piece, Jihyun Kim deepens the narrative by incorporating earth
        sourced from beneath London homes, layering the work with a sense of
        place and quiet reverence. This connection between material and meaning
        transforms Teoju into a contemplative vessel, both protective and
        poetic, rooted in cultural symbolism and urban archaeology.

        #### This body of series was inspired by Jihyun's grandmother's ritual
        of placing a small ceramic jar filled with salt near the entrance of
        their South Korean home. This jar was believed to prevent negative
        energy and evil spirits from entering the household, and it is a widely
        held belief and superstition in South Korea. Jihyun merged this
        tradition with the enchanting properties of fairy rings, which are
        circular formations of mushrooms that have been interpreted in various
        ways throughout history. Drawing inspiration from these two sources,
        Jihyun created a series of salt containers, aptly named 'Salty Fairy
        Ring' which embody a sense of wonder and magic. This series is a scaled
        up version of Salty Fairy Ring.

        #### The inspiration for 'Fingernail Fungi' came from Korean folklore
        about fingernails and the mouse. Jihyun's grandmother always told her
        not to cut her fingernails in the night because the mouse will eat them
        and become her.


        #### She incorporated this mystical tale with the poisonous and
        hand-like appearance of the Red coral fungi. The dangerous properties of
        the mushroom serve as the driving force behind the artwork, ensuring
        that the piece not only contains fingernails but also safeguards them
        from the covetous appetite of mice.

        #### This edition is a ceramic series inspired by the Korean tradition
        of Geumjul(금줄). Geumjul is the ancient Korean practice of hanging straw
        ropes to celebrate births and ward off evil spirits. Jihyun
        re-interpreted this tradition into contemporary ceramic pieces with a
        modern twist, capturing the spirit of cultural heritage in a fresh,
        innovative form.

        functional pottery.

        inspired by her cultural heritage and nature's mystical aspects. Her
        exploration of organic forms, especially fungi, infuses her pieces with
        magical narratives, inviting viewers to discover magic in the mundane.
        With meticulous attention to detail and a fusion of artistic form and
        utility, Jihyun's ceramics transcend the ordinary, embodying a
        harmonious blend of tradition and imagination.
